I've been a Blade Runner fan for a long time. I enjoy the Cyberpunk aesthetic as much as the next guy.

The Replicants' cards are an iconic set of graphical user interfaces.

[ilikeinterfaces website](https://ilikeinterfaces.com/2015/11/11/database-ui-blade-runner/) has some great examples we can use to get a good look at the layout.


I picked the cards because they looked rather simple.

Its only a few boxes, a couple videos of their spinning heads, and the information about their incept date and function.

If you have a copy of Blade Runner lying around, the scene where Decker gets the job to hunt for the replicants is around 13 mins in.


After doing some digging I came across [typesetinthefuture.com](https://typesetinthefuture.com/2016/06/19/bladerunner/) where they break down (a lot more than just) the typography throughout the film. Which for me was a huge help in figuring out a (useful, but not correct) font to use. (by "useful" i mean free/google font i could use)

[Here's the font I'm using](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Caslon+Text?preview.text=Replicant%20%20(M)%20Des:%20BATTY%20(Roy)&preview.text_type=custom)

I think/hope it's close enough to use.
